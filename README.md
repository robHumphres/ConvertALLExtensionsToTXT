# ConvertALLExtensionsToTXT
convert mass txt
Simple easy application. Needed something quick and dirty solution for converting. I had a project awhile back where I needed a simply convert all my files into a txt format to pass to an archive. 
Little did I know that doing this simple by hand was a pain in the butt, so I made a quick program that deals with a mass convert. 
All it needs is Current file path.

Pretty easy! gives you a notification if there's anything weird.
